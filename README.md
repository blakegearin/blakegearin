  Hi, my name's Blake. I'm interested in technology, business, and graphic design because I think they're crucial for creating valuable products, services, and systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  I graduated from
  <a href="https://www.truman.edu/">Truman State University</a>
  with degrees in Computer Science and Business Administration. Now I work at Airship as a software engineer.
  <br>
  <br>
  I'm eager to make the world more connected and better understood.
